# FAQ

## Why canâ€™t I mention sequence snippets out of order?

* It would be too easy to mix up two adjacent sequences that have the same length.
* Workaround: use `include="step1, step2, step3"`

## Debugging tips?

* Use `<!--marktest only-->` and you can inspect the files that were written to disk.
